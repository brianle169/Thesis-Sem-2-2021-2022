# Thesis-Sem-2-2021-2022
This repo contains code files for my thesis project. The topic I am working on is to develop an improved version of traditional Genetic Algorithm, by implementing the concept of Opposition-based Learning, as well as applying advanced genetic operators, to solve one of the most notorious production scheduling problem, the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem.

I forked and used the basic GA from https://github.com/guillaumebour/flexible-job-shop, hence you may find my code files arrangement to be fairly similar to **guillaumebour**. The program from **guillaumebour** follows strictly a research from Li and Gao (2016), the reference is attached below:

Li, X., & Gao, L. (2016). An effective hybrid genetic algorithm and tabu search for flexible job shop scheduling problem. International Journal of Production Economics, 174, 93â€“110. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.01.016

From the main GA implemented by **guillaumebour**, I modified and added different functions for my intended thesis topic, such as: opposition, multi-point crossover, etc. 

Thank you for reading!
